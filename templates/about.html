                        Ever since I was little, Iâ€™ve always wanted to draw.
                        Clique, right? Well, as time went on, I got greedier and
                        wanted more. I want to design.

                        What excites me about design is the amount of brainpower
                        it takes to create a good one. Itâ€™s about asking the
                        right questions, developing with a critical process, and
                        making decisions with purposes. It trains me to be
                        comfortable with ambiguity but continuously strive for
                        clarity by finding answers in people.

                        With an entrepreneurial spirit, Iâ€™m working as a solo UX
                        designer for a young startup and started a couple of NFT
                        projects. Iâ€™m now looking for opportunities to learn and
                        grow alongside the creative minds in the industry.

                        When not designing, Iâ€™m probably cooking up startup
                        ideas, enjoying listening to people, propagating plants,
                        and admiring wine bottle designs in the grocery store.
                        Iâ€™m obsessed with pixels and drawing on the trackpad â€”
